To run the scripts you must have these python libraries installed:
  -pynput
  -contextlib
  -dxcam
  -pillow
  -pyautogui
  -opencv-python

The scripts can be executed separatly since none depend on the other
The scripts can be executed all together by running full.py
The scripts will generate:
  -out.txt (the keylogger, where all the keys pressed will be seen there)
  -screenshot_{timestamp}.png
  -screen_record.mp4
